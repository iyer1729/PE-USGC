# PE-USGC
PE-USGC: Posture Estimation-based Unsupervised Spatial Gaussian Clustering for Supervised Classification of Obscured Human Motion

This repository contains the code to run the PE-USGC clustering and classification algorithm. Due to size limits, the data and pre-trained models are uploaded to Google Drive.

['models/' and 'data/'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1423v0WJplTxk0zCOnZIrx7bvaWOBzLUD?usp=share_link) need to be in the root of this project.

Please run main.py or use the models under 'models/' directory.
